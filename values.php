             <h2>Quality Assurance</h2>
            <p>We assure our end markets of the quality that has come to be expected by our industry and we go to great lengths to ensure this. Our quality check begins at the source where we screen produce for quality at the farm level, grading sheds and at the pack houses. Continental Fresh works closely with the farmers where they are given visual interpretations of any defects in the quality. We work only with trusted and credible farmers. We also maintain a state-of-the-art cold chain management system to maintain quality.</p>

            <p>We strive to maintain high quality standards through the following tenets: </p>
            <ul class="check-list">
